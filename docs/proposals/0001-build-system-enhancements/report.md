# Report for Proposal 0001: Build System Enhancements

**Proposal Status:** Catastrophic Failure

**Objective of Proposal 0001:**

The primary objective of Proposal 0001 was to establish a robust build system for the cogtools monorepo, specifically focusing on:

- TypeScript compilation and testing.
- Ensuring correct functioning of `pnpm typecheck` PRIOR to `pnpm build`.
- Avoiding dedicated generation of typings for internal development builds (while acknowledging the need for publishable libraries).

**Summary of Attempted Implementation:**

The attempted implementation involved a series of modifications to `tsconfig.json` files across the monorepo and adjustments to the build and typecheck scripts in the root `package.json`. The approach, as logged in the `report.txt`, evolved through several iterations, driven by the previous AI's interpretation of errors and attempts to achieve the stated objectives. A minimal practical case involving a dummy function in `@cogtools/lib` imported and executed by `@cogtools/cogtools` was used in an attempt to verify the build system.

The `.diff` provided reflects the code changes made during the attempt that were recorded as successful:

- Adding the `getGreeting` function to `packages/cogtools-lib/src/index.ts`.
- Adding a unit test for `getGreeting` in `packages/cogtools-lib/src/index.test.ts`.
- Modifying `packages/cogtools/src/index.ts` to import and use `getGreeting`.
- Adding a black-box test for the `@cogtools/cogtools` CLI in `packages/cogtools/src/index.test.ts`.

**Detailed Chronology of Events and Errors:**

The execution of Proposal 0001, as documented in the `report.txt`, encountered significant and ultimately unrecoverable issues related to TypeScript configuration and module resolution within the monorepo. The chronology below details the key commands executed, their immediate outcomes, and the errors observed. Interpretations of these events are attributed to the previous AI.

1.  **Initial Plan & Refinement:** The previous AI developed an initial plan and subsequently revised it based on user feedback regarding the desired avoidance of dedicated typings generation for internal builds and the need for typings for publishable libraries.
2.  **Milestone 1 & 2 Execution:** Commands were executed to modify source and test files in `@cogtools/lib` and to run `pnpm --filter @cogtools/lib test` and `pnpm --filter @cogtools/lib build`. The logs indicate these commands were reported as successful. A file system check (`ls packages/cogtools-lib/dist`) was logged as confirming the absence of `index.d.ts` after the build, aligning with the objective of no dedicated typings generation at that stage.
3.  **Milestone 3 Execution and Build Error:** Commands were executed to modify source and package.json files for `@cogtools/cogtools` and to run `pnpm --filter @cogtools/cogtools build`. The log records warnings during the build related to module formats (`import.meta` with cjs output, `commonjs-variable-in-esm`, `import-is-undefined`). The previous AI interpreted this as a conflict between `esbuild`'s output and the package's `type: "module"`.
4.  **Addressing Module Format:** The `scripts/build.mjs` file was modified. Subsequent rebuilds of `@cogtools/lib` and `@cogtools/cogtools` were logged as successful, and executing the compiled `@cogtools/cogtools` CLI (`node packages/cogtools/dist/index.js`) was logged as producing the expected output. Milestone 3 was logged as completed after this correction.
5.  **Milestone 4 Execution:** Commands were executed to modify the test file for `@cogtools/cogtools` and run `pnpm --filter @cogtools/cogtools test`. The test execution was logged as successful, and Milestone 4 was logged as completed.
6.  **Milestone 5 Execution Begins - Initial Errors:** A command was executed to introduce a deliberate type error in `@cogtools/lib`. Running `pnpm typecheck` (configured to run `tsc --noEmit` at this point) resulted in `TS2835` (relative import paths) and `TS7016` (could not find declaration file for `@cogtools/lib`) errors.
7.  **Addressing Import Paths and Project References:** A command was executed to modify `@cogtools/lib`'s test file to fix the relative import path. Commands were executed to modify the root `tsconfig.json`, which the previous AI interpreted as configuring project references.
8.  **`TS6305` and `TS6310` Errors:** Subsequent executions of `pnpm typecheck` (now configured to run `tsc -b`) consistently resulted in `TS6305` ("Output file '...' has not been built from source file...") and `TS6310` ("Referenced project '...' may not disable emit.") errors. The previous AI interpreted this as a conflict between `composite: true` and `noEmit: true` and that composite projects are expected to emit files.
9.  **Attempting `noEmit: true` in Package `tsconfig.json`:** Commands were executed to explicitly set `noEmit: true` in several package `tsconfig.json` files. Re-running `pnpm typecheck` continued to produce `TS6305` and `TS6310` errors.
10. **Reverting `noEmit: true` and Shifting Strategy:** Commands were executed to revert the `noEmit: true` changes in package `tsconfig.json` files. The root `typecheck` script in `package.json` was modified to `tsc -b`.
11. **Persistent `TS2307` Error:** Executions of `pnpm typecheck` consistently resulted in `TS2307` ("Cannot find module '@cogtools/lib' or its corresponding type declarations.") errors. The previous AI interpreted this as a module resolution issue where `tsc -b` could not find the declaration files for `@cogtools/lib`.
12. **Explicit `build:types` and Paths Mapping Attempts:** Commands were executed to introduce a `build:types` script in `@cogtools/lib`'s `package.json` (`tsc --emitDeclarationOnly --outDir dist`) and to modify the root `typecheck` script to run this before `tsc -b`. Commands were also executed to modify the root `tsconfig.json`, which the previous AI interpreted as adjusting `paths` mapping. Despite attempts to verify (`ls packages/cogtools-lib/dist`), the `TS2307` error persisted.
13. **Syntax Error in `tsconfig.json`:** A command intended to edit `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json` failed, and subsequent `pnpm typecheck` runs reported syntax errors (`TS5092`, `TS1012`). A command was executed to correct the syntax in `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json`.
14. **Continued `TS2307` and `TS6305` Errors:** Even after fixing the syntax error and executing commands to try various combinations of `paths`, `baseUrl`, `moduleResolution`, and `build:types` configurations, the `pnpm typecheck` command consistently failed with `TS2307` and sometimes `TS6305`.

**Integrated Analysis of Technical Failures:**

The "catastrophic failure" of Proposal 0001 stems from a fundamental and unresolved conflict in configuring TypeScript for cross-package type-checking within this pnpm monorepo, particularly concerning the interplay of composite projects, declaration file generation, and module resolution when aiming to avoid committing build artifacts for internal packages.

- **The `composite: true` Dilemma:** The repeated appearance of `TS6310` ("Referenced project '...' may not disable emit.") strongly indicates that a project marked with `composite: true` in its `tsconfig.json` is expected by `tsc -b` to be capable of emitting files, including `.d.ts` files. This stands in direct tension with the initial interpretation of the user's desired requirement to avoid dedicated typings generation for internal builds. It appears that for `tsc -b` to effectively leverage project references for incremental builds and accurate type resolution across packages, the referenced composite projects must be configured to emit their declarations. The previous AI's attempts to use `noEmit: true` in composite projects, or rely solely on a root `noEmit: true`, consistently led to errors, suggesting this approach is incompatible with the intended use of `composite: true` for inter-package type checking via `tsc -b`.

- **Elusive Declaration File Generation and Discovery:** A core unresolved issue was the inability to reliably generate `.d.ts` files for `@cogtools/lib` in a location and manner that `tsc -b` could discover and utilize them when type-checking dependent packages like `@cogtools/cogtools`.
  - The `TS6305` error ("Output file '...' has not been built from source file...") points to a problem with `tsc`'s emission process itself. Even with `declaration: true` and `outDir: "dist"` in `@cogtools/lib`'s `tsconfig.json`, running `tsc -b` from the root did not consistently produce `index.d.ts` in `packages/cogtools-lib/dist`. This suggests that the interaction between `tsc -b`, the package-specific `tsconfig.json`, and the monorepo structure was not correctly understood or configured. The previous AI's attempts to use `outFile` or adjust `rootDir` in `build:types` were attempts to force the output location, but they did not resolve the underlying `TS2307` in the `tsc -b` run.
  - The persistent `TS2307` error ("Cannot find module '@cogtools/lib' or its corresponding type declarations.") is the most critical symptom of the module resolution failure. Even when `index.d.ts` was confirmed to exist in `packages/cogtools-lib/dist` (when explicitly generated by `build:types`), `tsc -b` compiling `@cogtools/cogtools` could not find the necessary type information. This strongly suggests that the `paths` mapping in the root `tsconfig.json`, as configured during the attempt, was not effectively directing `tsc -b` to the location of the generated declarations. Research is needed to understand the precise algorithm `tsc -b` uses for module resolution in composite projects and how `paths` mapping interacts with this process and pnpm's workspace symlinks.

- **Fragile and Misaligned Workflow:** The attempted `typecheck` workflow, which involved a sequence of commands (`pnpm --filter @cogtools/lib build:types && tsc -b`), proved to be brittle. Failures in the first command (generating types) directly prevented the second command (type-checking) from functioning, masking the core type-checking problem with errors related to missing inputs. A more integrated approach where `tsc -b` itself is responsible for triggering the necessary declaration generation for all composite projects seems more aligned with TypeScript's intended workflow for monorepos.

**Information for Future Proposals:**

Based on the observed events and the integrated analysis of the failures during Proposal 0001, any future attempt to address the build system (specifically Proposal 0002) must prioritize the rigorous investigation and resolution of the following interconnected challenges:

- **Clarify Composite Project Requirements:** Directly investigate and confirm the behavior of `composite: true` with `tsc -b`. Does it strictly require the ability to emit `.d.ts` files for correct cross-package type resolution? Can `composite: true` be used solely for structural checks and project referencing without emission?
- **Establish Reliable Declaration Generation:** Determine a proven and consistent method for generating `.d.ts` files for all composite projects into their respective `dist` directories when running `tsc -b` from the monorepo root. This requires a deep understanding of how `tsc -b` interacts with `outDir`, `rootDir`, and other path configurations in the package `tsconfig.json` files within a monorepo context.
- **Solve Cross-Package Module Resolution:** Identify the correct configuration for `tsconfig.json` (likely the root) that enables `tsc -b` to reliably resolve module names (e.g., `@cogtools/lib`) to the location of the generated `.d.ts` files in the `dist` directories of composite projects within a pnpm workspace. This involves understanding the interaction of `paths` mapping, `moduleResolution`, and pnpm's linking strategy.
- **Design a Robust Type-Checking Workflow:** Develop a `typecheck` script in the root `package.json` that is not brittle. The goal is a single command (ideally `tsc -b`) that correctly triggers necessary declaration generation and performs comprehensive cross-package type-checking.
- **Validate Assumptions and Outputs:** Explicitly include steps to validate assumptions about tool behavior and verify intermediate outputs (like the presence and content of generated `.d.ts` files) throughout the implementation process.

This report provides a detailed and integrated analysis of the technical challenges encountered during Proposal 0001's implementation, highlighting the core conflicts and unresolved issues based on observed events and errors. This information is intended to serve as a factual and insightful basis for the development of Proposal 0002.
