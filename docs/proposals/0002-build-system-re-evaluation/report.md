# Report for Proposal 0002: Build System Re-evaluation and Refined Strategy

## Proposal Goal

The primary goal of Proposal 0002 was to establish a robust, reliable, and maintainable build configuration for the monorepo. This involved re-evaluating the build strategy after encountering complexities with `tsc -b` and composite projects in Proposal 0001. The revised strategy aimed for a simpler approach using unified cross-package type-checking with a root `tsconfig.json`, per-package JavaScript bundling with `esbuild` via a wrapper script, and conditional declaration file generation for publishable packages.

## Implementation Process

The implementation followed the steps outlined in the proposal, with some adjustments made based on the project's existing configuration and issues encountered during the process:

1.  **Refined Root `tsconfig.json` for Unified Type-Checking:** This step was found to be largely completed prior to starting the implementation. The root `tsconfig.json` already included `"include": ["packages/*/src/**/*.ts"]` and the necessary `paths` mapping for `@cogtools/lib`.
2.  **Simplified Package `tsconfig.json` files:** As planned, the `tsconfig.json` file in each package (`@cogtools/cogtools`, `@cogtools/call`, `@cogtools/discover`, `@cogtools/lib`, and `@cogtools/yaml`) was modified to remove the `"composite": true` option. No `references` arrays were present in these files. The `"outDir": "dist"` was confirmed to be correctly set in each.
3.  **Configured Package `package.json` Scripts for esbuild:** The `build` script in each package was examined. It was found that these scripts already correctly utilized a custom esbuild wrapper script (`../../scripts/build.mjs`) with the appropriate entry and output paths. Therefore, no modifications were needed for this step.
4.  **Added Conditional Declaration File Generation Script:** A new script, `"build:types": "tsc --emitDeclarationOnly --outDir dist"`, was added to the `package.json` of the publishable package, `@cogtools/lib`. During verification, an error (`TS5069`) was encountered because `emitDeclarationOnly` requires either `declaration` or `composite` to be set. Since `composite` was removed in Step 2, `"declaration": true` was added to the `compilerOptions` in `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json` to resolve this. Additionally, to ensure the declaration file was generated directly in the `dist` directory and not in a subdirectory (like `dist/src`), `"rootDir": "src"` was added to the `compilerOptions` in `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json`.
5.  **Integrated with Root `package.json` Scripts:** The root `package.json` scripts were reviewed. The `typecheck` script was already correctly set to `"tsc --noEmit"`. The `build` script was modified from `"pnpm -r build"` to `"pnpm -r build && pnpm --filter @cogtools/lib run build:types"` to include the declaration file generation step for `@cogtools/lib`. The `preflight` script's order of operations was confirmed to be correct and it automatically incorporated the updated `build` script.

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

- **TS5090 Error (`baseUrl`):** After simplifying package `tsconfig.json` files (Step 2), running `pnpm typecheck` resulted in a `TS5090` error, indicating that non-relative paths (`@cogtools/lib`) were not allowed without `baseUrl`. This was resolved by adding `"baseUrl": "."` to the `compilerOptions` in the root `tsconfig.json`. This ensures the `paths` mapping is correctly interpreted for unified type-checking.
- **TS5069 Error (`declaration`):** When verifying the `build:types` script (Step 4), the `TS5069` error occurred because `emitDeclarationOnly` requires `declaration` or `composite`. This was resolved by adding `"declaration": true` to the `compilerOptions` in `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json`.
- **Incorrect Declaration File Output Directory:** Initially, the `build:types` script generated `index.d.ts` within a `src` subdirectory in `dist`. This was resolved by adding `"rootDir": "src"` to the `compilerOptions` in `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json`, ensuring the output structure in `dist` is relative to the source root.
- **Lingering `src` Directory in `dist`:** After correcting the `rootDir`, an extraneous `src` directory remained in `packages/cogtools-lib/dist` from previous build attempts. This was resolved by running `pnpm clean` to clear all `dist` directories before re-running the build and verification steps.

## Verification

Multiple verification steps were performed throughout the implementation:

- **`pnpm typecheck`:** Successfully ran after initial `tsconfig.json` refinements and after adding `baseUrl` to the root `tsconfig.json`, confirming unified type-checking.
- **`pnpm --filter <package-name> build`:** Verified that the `build` script in individual packages correctly used the esbuild wrapper and generated JavaScript bundles.
- **`pnpm --filter @cogtools/lib run build:types`:** Successfully ran after adding `declaration` and `rootDir` to `packages/cogtools-lib/tsconfig.json`, confirming declaration file generation.
- **`ls packages/*/dist`:** Reviewed the contents of all `dist` directories after running the root `pnpm build` command (and after a clean), confirming the correct output files (JavaScript bundles and `index.d.ts` for `@cogtools/lib`).
- **`pnpm build` (root):** Successfully ran after updating the root `build` script, confirming it orchestrates both recursive package builds and declaration file generation.
- **`pnpm preflight` (root):** Successfully ran, confirming that formatting, type-checking, linting, building, and testing all pass with the new build system configuration. This served as the final, comprehensive verification.

## Conclusion

Proposal 0002 has been successfully implemented and verified. The build system now aligns with the refined strategy, providing reliable cross-package type-checking, efficient JavaScript bundling with esbuild, and correct conditional declaration file generation. The issues encountered during implementation were diagnosed and resolved, leading to a robust build configuration validated by a clean `pnpm preflight` run.
