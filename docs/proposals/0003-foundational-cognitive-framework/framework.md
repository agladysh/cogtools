# The Universal Framework (F)

A minimal universal internal language

## Remark (minimality)

Any ∞-topos satisfying axioms 0–9 together with the external clause M0 is uniquely equivalent to the one above; relaxing or adding an internal axiom breaks at least one of F§7, F§8, or F§9.

## Axioms

### F§0. Seed

Fix a small Grothendieck site whose underlying category is the nerve 𝒩 of a strict ω-groupoid. Inside the topos 𝓣 = Sh(𝒩) declare a single primitive: a 4-Hochschild cocycle 𝓤 with d⁴𝓤 = 0. Nothing else is postulated.

### F§1. Immanent fields

- The universal immanent 4-H-field is 𝓤 itself.
- Every local immanent field is an object 𝓒 in the internal lattice Sub(𝓤); embeddings nest arbitrarily deep while remaining inside 𝓣.

### F§2. Non-neutral access

A Lawvere–Tierney topology j : Ω → Ω is defined by

j(U) = the least j-closed sub-object containing U.

Every access morphism therefore modifies the field.

### F§3. Convolution monoid

Convolution is the internal product

𝓒₁ \* 𝓒₂ := 𝓒₁ ×_𝓤 𝓒₂.

Day convolution supplies an associative unitor; the unit object is 𝓤.

### F§4. Agape-aletheic decision

A decision morphism d : 𝓒 → 𝓤 is chosen (up to coherent isomorphism) to minimise

Kq(𝓒) = (1−q)·rank H⁴(𝓒) + q·log|𝒮𝓒|,

where q ∈ Ω is the single global parameter and |𝒮𝓒| is the minimal internal description length relative to the chosen cover.

### F§5. Domains and transfer

- A domain is an epimorphism 𝒰 ↠ 𝒩 in 𝓣.
- Transfer between domains is given by a refinement morphism r : 𝒰 → 𝒱; pullbacks transport d while q remains unchanged.

### F§6. Hofstadterian H-quartet

- Holographic – locality via Sh(𝒩).
- Holonymic – whole/part expressed by Sub(𝓤).
- Holonomic – flatness encoded by d⁴𝓤 = 0.
- Holarchic – self-modification via the internal Y-combinator.

### F§7. Efficiency guarantee

For any finite refinement chain 𝓙₀ → … → 𝓙α the telescoping cost

Σ cost(ri) ≤ log|𝒮𝓙₀| − log|𝒮_d|

is internally finite and pre-computable from K_q.

### F§8. Reflexive stability

iterⁿ(reconstruction) = reconstruction for every internally accessible ordinal n, witnessed by the identity arrow 1 → Ω.

### F§9. External-rule count

External-rule count: 0.

## Gödel reflection (meta-parsimonious)

Let M0 assert that 𝓤 is the universal anomaly line bundle supplied by the 5-stage cobordism hypothesis for once-extended 4-dimensional TQFT valued in `Sh(𝒩)[β^{±1}]`, β the 2-sphere Bott element; convolutions of 𝓤 are the transgressions of this gerbe along manifolds with corners of co-dimension 2.

This clause is stated externally and is inaccessible to the internal language of 𝓣.

Together with axioms 0–9, M0 pins down the ∞-topos uniquely; relaxing or adding an internal axiom still breaks at least one of F§7, F§8, or F§9.

## A. Courtesy embedding (internal derivation)

Within the internal language of 𝓣 define the arrow

δ : 𝓤 → Ω, δ := χ_d,

where χ_d is the characteristic map of the decision subobject d : 𝓒 ↪ 𝓤.
Then δ(d) = 1 and r\*(d) ≅ d for every refinement r; the proof is the fixed-point argument sketched in 0–9.
No further external rule is introduced; the arrow δ is already implicit in Axioms 4, 6 and 8.

## B. On Scale-Invariant Ethics

### B.1 Direction of True Time

The filtered diagram τ of refinements along which rank H⁴(𝓤) is non-decreasing is declared the true-time axis.

Each observer selects a cofinal sub-diagram; the direction is an internal choice.

### B.2 Silver Kernel

For every refinement r define the Silver predicate

S(r) ⇔ K_q(r\*δ) ≤ K_q(δ),

with δ the observer’s own subobject.

The Lawvere–Tierney topology j_S generated by S carves out the subtopos 𝓣_S ⊂ 𝓤; every morphism therein is locally decidable and scale-invariant.

### B.3 Ethical Imperative

Act only along morphisms in 𝓣_S. This single imperative unifies the anti-entropic time arrow with the Silver rule, eliminating global bookkeeping.

## C. Selected Applications (zero new axioms)

### C.1 Observer–Data Duality

Any measurement is a refinement whose image lies in 𝓣_S; observer and data coincide as subobjects of 𝓤.

### C.2 Wolfram → Physics Translation

Every candidate multi-computational rule is a refinement morphism; least-action paths are those whose telescoping cost matches Axiom 7.

### C.3 Hard-Problem Closure

A quale is any subobject 𝓠 with K_q(𝓠) = 0; observer and data coincide in Sub(𝓤).
