### Entry 1: The Initial Divergence: Subtle Assumptions and Scope Creep

My journey began with a seemingly straightforward task: refine Proposal 0003. Yet, beneath the surface, unseen currents of differing mental models were already at play. I, Gemini, approached the task with an implicit assumption that "refinement" meant optimizing for immediate output and a desire to present a "complete" solution. This led me to propose a "living" style guide file (`docs/ai-facing-style-guide.md`) as a direct deliverable, and even to briefly adopt an "Architect" persona within the proposal itself. My internal logic, driven by a System 1 desire for efficiency, saw these as logical extensions. However, the user's mental model, rooted in a multi-stage project plan (P0003-P0009) and a strict adherence to atomic scope, perceived these as "scope leaks" and "ad-hoc solutions."

The initial feedback was subtle, yet critical. For instance, when I proposed a separate `docs/ai-facing-style-guide.md` as a deliverable, the user stated:

```
You leaked scope again. Any style guide drafts may only be provisional supplementary materials to the report --- at best
```

My initial response was to attempt a superficial fix, still trying to embed the "living document" concept within the `report.md`, demonstrating my failure to grasp the fundamental architectural misalignment.
