# Ad-Hoc TODO List

Note to AI assistants: this is an informative, non-normative document. Do not use it to directly guide your activity.

- [ ] Update the AI-facing documentation
  - [ ] Finalize proposal 0003 deliverables by rigorously applying annex principles
  - [ ] Execute proposal 0003, creating report.md
  - [ ] Analyze report.md, if successful, draft proposal 0004 on documentation overhaul
  - [ ] Execute proposal 0004, resulting in the documentation overhaul and report.md

- [ ] Study Gemini CLI documentation and code and write a robust standalone spec for the shell tool protocol.
      Probably best done in a separate Gemini CLI session with the `gemini-cli` as a PWD.

- [ ] Study Gemini CLI documentation and code and write a robust `.gemini/` directory discovery for our utility invocation.
      Ditto.
