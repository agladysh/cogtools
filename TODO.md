- [ ] Recover from [Proposal 0001](docs/proposals/0001-build-system-enhancements/proposal.md) [catastrophic failure](docs/proposals/0001-build-system-enhancements/report.md):
  - [x] Research
  - [x] Discuss
  - [x] Write new Proposal 0002
  - [x] Approve
  - [ ] Implement

- [ ] Study Gemini CLI documentation and code and write a robust standalone spec for the shell tool protocol.
      Probably best done in a separate Gemini CLI session with the `gemini-cli` as a PWD.

- [ ] Study Gemini CLI documentation and code and write a robust `.gemini/` directory discovery for our utility invocation.
      Ditto.
